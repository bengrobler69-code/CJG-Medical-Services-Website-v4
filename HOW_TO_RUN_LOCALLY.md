# 🚀 How to Run CJG Medical Website Locally

## ✅ You're Already Set Up!

Good news! Your development server is already running. You can view your website right now!

## 🌐 View Your Website

Open your browser and go to:
**http://localhost:3000**

The development server is already running in the background. You should see your beautiful CJG Medical Services website!

## 📝 To Run It Yourself Later

If you close the terminal and want to run it again, just follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Open Terminal in Your Project
Navigate to your project folder:
```
cd C:\Users\bengr\OneDrive\Website
```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server
Type this command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait for it to say "Ready" (about 3 seconds).

### Step 3: Open Your Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🛑 To Stop the Server

When you're done viewing the site:
1. Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
2. That stops the development server

## 📁 What You Have

Your website is saved locally in your project folder. It's NOT published anywhere yet - it's just on your computer for you to view and test.

### Your Files
- All your pages are in the `app/` folder
- Components are in `components/` folder
- Everything runs locally - no one else can see it until you publish it

## ✅ Next Steps (Only When You're Ready)

**For now**: Just view it at http://localhost:3000 and enjoy your beautiful website!

**When ready to publish later**: We'll deal with Vercel or other hosting then. For now, you just have it locally on your computer.

## 💡 Quick Tips

- **Edit files**: Make changes to any `.tsx` or `.ts` files and they'll update automatically in your browser
- **Refresh**: The page auto-refreshes when you save changes
- **Port**: If port 3000 is busy, Next.js will suggest the next available port (like 3001)

**You're all set! Just go to http://localhost:3000 to see your site! 🎉**
